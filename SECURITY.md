### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability, you **MUST** report it so that we can fix it

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to <padventures.contact@gmail.com> and provide suitable information

> [!NOTE]
> Spam sent to the provided email address will be ignored and the person responsible will be appropriately dealt with

Vulnerabilities that are submitted will generally be accepted and reports will be reviewed as soon as possible

Please stick to the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when reporting the vulnerability

#### Accepted reports

If your report is accepted, code owners and maintainers will try and patch the vulnerability as quickly as we can.
Committed fixes will have ambiguous names to not point out the vulnerability before it is merged, published and released.

A thank you email will also follow your report

#### Denied reports

If your report is denied, you will receive a response email saying exactly why.
Reports aren't typically denied, but false vulnerability reports will be rejected.
